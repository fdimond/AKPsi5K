# AKPsi5K

### Purpose
<p>
I volunteered myself to the AKPsi Rho Chapter at the University of Washington as a web dev for their charity run in the spring of 2017. The organization needed images and descriptions updated to the page but tabled any major redesigns for simplicity's sake. Similarly, a new database needed to be created to accept entry forms by runners of the event.

### What I learned
<p>
Although my skill in HTML, CSS and Javascript were strong; this would be my first battle with databases. Updating the look of the website with the given resources and guidance of AKPsi was simple; but work quickly hit a wall after my attempts to create a database within UW's hosting system. After emailing the administrator for UW's, a defect was found in our permissions for creating databases on UW's end. Work sped back up and runners were able to register for the event on time. Don't be afraid to ask for help.
